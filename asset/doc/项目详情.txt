Project 1：
BioCell Pavilion
UC Architecture Master 2024 Semester 1 Architecture Studio  
Imstructor: Mike Louw
Site: National Botanical garden, Canberra, Australia
Building Area:1200㎡
Indivicual Work
The Australian National Botanic Gardens (ANBG) in Canberra is embarking on a visionary redesign to confront the growing threat of Armillaria root rot, a fungal disease endangering native plant species. The project seeks to restore ecological balance and protect Australia’s unique flora through innovative landscape and architectural strategies.
Inspired by traditional Southeast Asian wooden architecture, the design introduces elevated structures that minimize soil contact, slowing the spread of the disease. These platforms will showcase resilient native plants, preserving botanical diversity while creating immersive visitor experiences.
Sustainability is central to the project, with locally sourced Australian gumwood used for its durability and pest resistance. Integrated rainwater harvesting systems and timber lattices with climbing plants provide natural shading and climate control, blending functionality with beauty.
Through enhanced pathways, viewing decks, and educational spaces, the ANBG will evolve into a living classroom, inspiring visitors to learn about sustainable gardening, biodiversity, and disease management. This redesign ensures the gardens remain a vibrant cultural and ecological landmark for future generations.








Project 2：
IMBUE
UC Architecture Master 2024 Semester 1 Architecture Laboratory
Imstructor: Ann Cleary
Site: City, Canberra, Australia
Building Area:400㎡
Indivicual Work
At the heart of City Hill, Imbue is a water-based landscape installation designed to cool, soothe, and connect. By harnessing the natural rhythm of water flow and circulation, the project aims to alleviate the urban heat island effect and restore balance within the surrounding environment.
More than an architectural gesture, Imbue creates a refuge within the city — a tranquil space where residents, workers, and visitors can pause, breathe, and reconnect with nature. The gentle play of light and water, combined with thoughtfully designed shaded zones, transforms the installation into both an urban sanctuary and a climatic response.
Merging landscape, architecture, and ecology, Imbue celebrates the cooling power of water while inviting people to slow down, reflect, and immerse themselves in an evolving dialogue between the built environment and the natural world.













Project 3：
Resonance
UC Architecture Master 2025 May Architecture Studio 3
Imstructor: Ann Cleary
Site: Woden, Canberra, Australia
Building Area: 5000㎡
Indivicual Work
Resonance reimagines the vibrant mural culture of Woden as an architectural and spatial strategy. Rather than treating graffiti as surface decoration, the design abstracts the positions and energies of existing street murals into a conceptual diagram. This invisible framework organizes program, shapes form, and choreographs circulation across the site.
The building is composed of three volumes — for performance, training, and support — arranged in response to this mural-based geometry. Vertical circulation elements, such as staircases and elevators, follow these hidden mural paths, turning movement itself into a central architectural theme. Space is experienced not through static boundaries but through flows, transitions, and rhythm.
A translucent polycarbonate skin enhances this spatial reading. Light, bodies, and motion animate the façade from within, as users walking, climbing, and leaping appear as fleeting shadows. Over time, these silhouettes create a living mural made of presence and movement. Resonance does not depict murals; it becomes one.











Project 4：
Helix
UC Architecture Master 2024 Semester 2 Architecture Studio
Imstructor: Michael Jasper
Site: City, Canberra, Australia
Building Area: 40000㎡
Indivicual Work
Helix is a civic forum located at the intersection of the UNSW Canberra campus, Commonwealth Park, and nearby office precincts. The design draws inspiration from Le Corbusier’s Congress Hall in Strasbourg, particularly its exploration of spatial fluidity and movement. This influence is expressed through a gently spiraling external corridor that ascends the facade, guiding visitors from the ground plane to the elevated city chamber while deliberately bypassing enclosed office floors.
The circulation itself becomes an architectural narrative, inviting the public on a continuous journey that touches entertainment levels, lingers at an open terrace, and culminates in a symbolic space of assembly. The building is formed by four interlocking blocks rotated around a central square, creating shifting perspectives and porous boundaries between interior and exterior. Public spaces such as exhibition halls, reading lounges, and cafés are distributed across multiple levels and linked through open-air bridges and rooftop gardens.
Helix embodies a civic spirit of transparency and interconnection. Architecture here becomes dynamic—less a static container and more a flowing sequence of experiences, where movement defines form and space shapes community.



Project 5：
Hidden Garden | Project Introduction
July 2022 Competition Submissions
Co-team member: Henry Liu
Location: Chaoyang District, Beijing, China
Building Area: 1800㎡
Cooperative work
Hidden Garden is an art gallery located within a residential community in Beijing’s Chaoyang District. Inspired by the spatial composition of classical Chinese gardens, the design combines traditional courtyard aesthetics with a modern minimalist facade to create a tranquil artistic sanctuary within the city.
Five square volumes are arranged in a staggered layout, enclosing a central courtyard that serves as the heart of the experience. This layered composition evokes the memory and philosophy of traditional Chinese courtyards — a “hidden beauty” that gradually unfolds as visitors move through framed views, shifting light, and shadow.
The program integrates flexible exhibition areas, interactive zones that foster audience engagement, and intimate relaxation spaces. White facades paired with glass create a refined, elegant aesthetic, while abundant greenery and water features form a natural ecological environment.
Hidden Garden is more than a venue for art; it is a platform for cultural exchange and contemplation. By weaving together, the traditions of Chinese garden design with modern architectural language, the project offers an immersive and timeless journey into space, nature, and memory.
